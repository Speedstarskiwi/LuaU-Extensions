# LuaU-Extensions

As you know, roblox's luau compiler and other extensions have been open sourced: https://github.com/roblox/luau

This **creates** an advantage for us exploiters, but the `Luau` project doesn't have compatiablity with `uintptr_t` types.

This repo *kinda* creates some extensions for `Luau`, which you can use in your custom exploit or `compiler`, enjoy!
